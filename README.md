# Qt_tutorials
My journey learning how to make apps then games~!
## each folder is a different project
> * each project will have a read me of infomation
> * Most of these projects are made by following the [qt tutorials online](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtexamplesandtutorials.html) and some changes made by me
> * if you think the README is vague or missing infomation please feel free to contact me (*i wonder if my contact infomation is visible*)
